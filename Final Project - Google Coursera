/* Station IDs 460, 412, 37, 21, 50 have the highest number of docks across the whole city and also seem to have a fairly 
good balance between the number of docks/number of bikes available at a given point.
Station IDs 350, 363, 75, 467, 197 appear to be empty as shown by the high availability of docks. Worth pointing out that 
Station IDs 350 and 197 also have a very few bikes available at a given point, highlighting the higher demand for bikes in 
these stations, compared to the other 3, who seem to have a fair balance between the empty docks as well as available bikes, 
highlighting low demand.
The most famous stations where people start their trip or end their trip appear to be the same, although these stations donâ€™t 
appear on the list for stations with maximum number of docks. Highlighting the need for more docks in these stations to 
accommodate more people. */

/* The top 3 most famous trips are between Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building) to Embarcadero at Sansome, San Francisco 
Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend) to Townsend at 7th and 2nd at Townsend to Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building). Most of these 
stations are also the favorites to start or end a trip, as seen before.
The most famous round trips occur at Embarcadero at Sansome, Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building) and The Embarcadero at 
Sansome St. Since these happen to be the iconic spots of the city, people are probably renting bikes to go around these 
stations. Although frequently used, none of these stations appear on the list for having the highest number of docks. */

probably use the bikes for a long term, compared to the one-time users.
Although its interesting to see that a one-time Customer spends on average ~5 times more duration on the bikes, compared to 
the Subscriber. Probably the case being subscribers know the whereabouts of the city better than the Customer, who would be 
a temporary visitor to the city. */



/* RECOMMENDATION:
Based on the analysis, it is highly recommended to increase the number of docks at stations Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry 
Building), Embarcadero at Sansome and San Francisco Caltrain 2. Since the data shows that these stations are mostly in high 
demand from users and also have the highest count of trips to and from them. These areas also happen to be the epicenter of 
tourism in the city, where visitors from around the world come to explore the rich heritage of San Francisco. Also to note 
that, these areas have broad and well maintained bike lanes, making it easier and safer for bikers to go around exploring. 
Increasing the number of docks would mean higher number of bike availability, translating to more usage of the bikes. */
